# Practice Hour

This is the Swift code repository for [Practice Hour](https://learnappmaking.com/live).

- Practice Hour a live screencast, to learn Swift programming and iOS development.
- We're going to sit down and code Swift together. I’ll walk you through the code, practice with you, and help you write your own Swift code.
- Practice Hour is not merely an iOS tutorial. It's about much more: practice, experimentation and problem-solving. See for yourself!
- It’s interactive, and there’s always time for Q&A. Everyone is welcome! It’s live, so if you don’t join, you’ll miss it...

After every Practice Hour, I'll add the Swift code we've written to this repository.

## How to Use

Some ideas about using the Swift code in this repository:

- Practice Hour is about practice! Get your hands dirty, and practice with the concepts and code we've discussed in Practice Hour.
- You can use the code here to cheat, when you're practicing Swift coding on your own, or as a reference to check your work.
- We often come up with a challenge during Practice Hour, such as writing a bit of Swift code. Why don't you give those challenges a try?
